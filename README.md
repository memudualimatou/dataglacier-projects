## ⚙️ HOW DOES THE INSURANCE CHARGES PREDICTION SYSTEM WORKS?

This sytem is a flask responsive web application  hosted on heroku. It predicts a student chance of getting admitted into the university based on the following scores.
The GRE Score
TOEFL Score
University Rating
SOP - Statement of Purpose
LOR - Letter of Recommendation
CGPA - Cumulative Grade Point Average
Research-- Made a research? (Yes=1/No=0)

SOP stands for Statement of Purpose which is a necessary document for graduate applications. Basically explains why you are applying to that program/college.
LOR stands for Letter of Recommendation which is also a necessary document as a part of your application. It has letters from your professors/mentors/managers endorsing your application and supporting your candidature for the program.
